<p>Hi, my name is Matt Wujekâ€”but most of my friends call me "Wuj". My colleagues know me as an approachable designer who values honesty, humor, and humility. I'm energized by design craft, especially of the unexpected and unusual variety, but I also crave digginging into hefty UX challenges. My work has covered a broad range of applications from consumer-facing mobile and web experiences to complex internal tools. I've worked at fast-paced startups, meticulous and calculated tech firms, and everything in between.

				<p>I'm currently looking for my next big challenge and in the meantime, I'll be tinkering on something in my workshop and playing fetch with my dogs. Thanks for stopping by ðŸ™ƒ</p>
